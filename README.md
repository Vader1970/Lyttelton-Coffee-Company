User Experience Design
Brief
Based on your chosen project scenario, your task is to follow and document the user experience design process of an application or website and implement an interface derived from this process using web technologies.

Scenarios
Creating new ways for customers to engage with your brand can be a great way to increase awareness and drive sales. You are to develop a prototype that has been developed through a UX design process. Select one scenario from below.

Hospitality digital ordering

An existing restaurant/cafe or bar want to improve customer engagement and sales of some of their more unique offerings by providing table ordering via digital devices. Customers will be able to use touch screens at their table or booth, tablet type devices mounted at the bar or on phones anywhere in the venue. They require a system that enables customers to easily order and see the progress of their order, view deals and make suggestions.

Home automation health and security

An existing electronics company is planning to release a new service for homeowners. Using a series of connected devices (smoke detectors, cameras, audio devices, lights, blind controls, etc.) they intend to give customers control of their home and awareness of its health and security. Customers will be able to monitor and control their home from wall mounted tablets, and a web app accessed and controlled on smart TVs or from anywhere using their mobile phone.

Environmental/social enterprise website

ECO – Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand are a non-profit network of 50 + organisations with a concern for conservation and the environment. An ECO member organisation would like you to undertake a review of their existing site’s user experience and formulate a plan for a site redesign that includes a web-based prototype. The goals of the website are to increase public awareness of their cause, provide a welcoming call to action to join the organisation, and maintain the engagement of existing members. The organisation hopes to have a modern and insightful representation of what they do. They would like to know how effectively they are currently achieving these goals and receive a plan for improving at least one functionality related to the website’s goals.

Tasks

Your plan must include:

formative research results with analysis and conclusions 
identification of implications of the Treaty of Waitangi and relevant design considerations
